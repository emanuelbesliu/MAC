The solution for well known MacBook Pro 2011 GPU issue.

From my experience I can say that a GPU reflow is not worth it such that the problem is temporary fixed (probably one week or two).
This method disables the Discrete GPU - not usable anymore. 
Some of you would ask if the MAC's running smoothly with only the integrated GPU. YES, it does (not a huge difference when speaking of basic tasks).

Steps:

1. Shut down your MAC and BOOT in Single User Mode > 

  CMD + S
  
2. After all the checks complete type these commands >

nvram fa4ce28d-b62f-4c99-9cc3-6815686e30f9:gpu-power-prefs=%01%00%00%00

reboot

3. BOOT your MAC in Recovery Mode > 
  
  CMD + R
  
4. When on Recovery Mode > Utilities > Terminal
5. Press the following command > 
  
  csrutil disable
  
6. Then check the status >
  
  csrutil status - it should be disabled
  
7. Reboot the system >

  reboot
  
8. BOOT in Single User Mode >

  CMD + S

9. Now we run a File System Check >

  fsck -fy
  
10. After finishing we mount the writing access >

  mount -uw /
  
11. Creating new directory where all Discrete GPU extensions go >

  mkdir /DisabledExtensions
  
12. Moving all the extensions into the newly created directory >

  mv /System/Library/Extensions/AMD* /DisabledExtenstions/
  
  FOR NVIDIA GPU SEARCH FOR EXTENSIONS IN
  
  cd /System/Library/Extensions/
  
  AND MOVE ALL THE NVIDIA EXTENSIONS TO DisabledExtensions DIRECTORY
  
  mv /System/Library/Extensions/(extension) /DisabledExtensions/
  
13. After completing the moving we're good to go >

  reboot

Now everything should be fine, the system will be using only the integrated GPU.
